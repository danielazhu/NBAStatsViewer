NBAStatsViewer
==============

This Java Applet allows users to quickly look up the 2014-2015 current season stats for NBA players. After users enter in a player's name, data is retrieved from basketball-reference.com. The current season data is displayed in a table and changes over time can be visualized as a graph after clicking on a stats column. The program is working as of 12/27/2014. If basketball-reference.com changes its format, please contact me through GitHub.

Lebron James' points on a per game basis can be visualized by searching "Lebron James" and then clicking on the points column:
